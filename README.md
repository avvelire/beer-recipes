# Beer Recipes

I create this web-application to show you my developer skills

## Technologies:

- **ReactJS**
- **TypeScript**
- **Zustand**
- **React Router**
- **Fetch**
- **React Hooks**
- **Prettier**
- **CSS-Modules / SCSS**

## Options

I'm add implement lazy scroll functionality. If the user will scroll to the bottom of the list, the first 5 recipes should be removed from render and next 5 should be added. This way user will be able to see 5 new recipes but the rendered amount will always be 15.
Also users can go to a single recipe page by clicking on recipe card with mouse left button. He delete recipes, choose multiple and delete them.
