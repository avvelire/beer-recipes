# Beer Recipes

I created this web-application to show  my skills

## Technologies:

- **ReactJS**
- **TypeScript**
- **Zustand**
- **React Router**
- **Fetch**
- **React Hooks**
- **Prettier**
- **CSS-Modules / SCSS**

## Options

Implemented lazy scroll functionality. If the user will scroll to the bottom of the list, the first 5 recipes should be removed from render and next 5 should be added. This way user will be able to see 5 new recipes, but the rendered amount always will be 15. Also user can go to a single recipe page by clicking on recipe card with mouse left button. User can choose  recipes and delete them as well.
